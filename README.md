 Everything about Machine Learning (ML)

---------------------------------------------

## I. Machine Learning

### 1. What's Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that learn from and make decisions based on data.

---------------------------------------------

### 2. Why using Machine Learning?

Machine Learning enables computers to solve problems and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.

---------------------------------------------

### 3. ML Categories
- **a. Supervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from labeled training data, and makes predictions based on that.
- **b. Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data without guidance.
- **c. Semi-Supervised Learning**: Combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training.
- **d. Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms learn to perform an action from experience by maximizing some notion of cumulative reward.

---------------------------------------------

## IV. Applying Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised: Classification
Techniques for categorizing items into a discrete set of categories.

### 2. Supervised: Prediction
Predicting a continuous-valued attribute associated with an object.

### 3. Forecasting: Time Series
Analyzing time series data to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics.

### 4. Unsupervised: Clustering
Grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.

### 5. Unsupervised: Dimensionality Reduction
Reducing the number of random variables under consideration, to gain insights into the data.

### 6. Semi-supervised
Combining labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy.

### 7. Reinforcement
Learning how to act or make decisions by trying out actions and seeing the results.
